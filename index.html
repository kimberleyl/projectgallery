        <h1>Kimberley Kim</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my page. I am an architect by profession, and have always had a passion for everything related to technology. <br>
            Coding however is a completely new world to me and I am fascinated by the endless possibilities it opens up. <br>
            My hobbies include entertaining my friends with quirky games and designs, as well as exploring my interests in architecture. <br>
            Below is a project gallery that showcases a few coding projects that reflect these passions - I look forward to improving them as I gain more skills. </p>
